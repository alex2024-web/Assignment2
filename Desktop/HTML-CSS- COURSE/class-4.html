<h1 >A reseach on biomass</h1>
<p>Biomass, as a renewable energy source, consists of organic materials derived from plants and animals. The major components in biomass include:

 <p>Cellulose: A complex carbohydrate found in the cell walls of plants. It is a primary structural component and the most abundant organic compound on Earth.</p>
  <h1>a cellulolisic components</h1>
  <p>Hemicellulose: Another complex carbohydrate, often found alongside cellulose in plant cell walls. It has a more branched structure compared to cellulose.</p>
  
  <p>A complex polymer that provides rigidity to plant cell walls. It acts as a binder for cellulose fibers but can be a challenge to break down during biomass conversion processes.</p>
  
  <p >Starch: Found in grains, tubers, and other plant storage organs, starch is a carbohydrate that serves as an energy reserve in plants.
  <h1>A starchy component</h1>
  <p >Sugars: Simple carbohydrates like glucose and sucrose are present in various forms in biomass. They can be directly utilized or converted into other forms for energy production.</p>
  
  <p>Proteins and Amino Acids: Biomass often contains proteins, which are composed of amino acids. These can contribute to the overall composition and nutritional value of the biomass.</p>
  
<p>Oils and Fats: Some biomass sources, like certain seeds and algae, contain oils and fats. These can be extracted and converted into biofuels or used for various industrial applications.</p>
